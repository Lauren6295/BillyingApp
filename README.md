# billyingApp
Homework 1 Objectives:  Use DOM manipulation, create, add, remove and manipulate HTML elements programmatically using JavaScript DOM API Use DOM events, add and remove element events to handle behavior in the application programmatically Use Arrays, create, add and remove items Use Objects, properties and manipulation Use functions, use named and anonymous functions Problem description  A company requires a custom web app to register all the bills, currently the company only have 3 bill types (A, B, C), the general purpose of the software is to facilitate the way the bills are registered and to automatically compute the total sum for each bill type. The app must include 3 sections, a form to register new bills, a table to display and sort all the bills and a section to show the total computed sum for each bill type, all the sections should be on a single page. In the form section the user can add new bills, each bill includes name, amount, date and type. The form must validate name, amount and type as required fields before submitting. Also when the user submits the form it should reset automatically to allow the user to continue adding more bills. The table should display all the bills registered, it includes columns for name, type, date and amount, the sortable fields are name, type and amount, by default the list is sorted by name alphabetically descending. The sortable fields in the table must be reversible, so when the user clicks a table`s header for a sortable field the list is sorted by the corresponding field, when the user clicks again the same sortable fields the sort order must be inverted in the same field, by default the sort should be descending, alphabetically for text and by value in the amount case. The last section shows the total sum for each bill type, so this total should be automatically updated each time a new bill is added to always be updated. Evaluations  The programs includes the 3 sections; form, table and total The form validates the required inputs The form submits and adds a new bill item The from reset button works The form automatically resets itself after submitting The table display correctly all the bills The table sort by name, type and amount The sort is reversed for each sortable field The total is correctly calculated and update when new bills are added Technical Requirements:  IFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is used Named functions are used on event handler DOM is created programmatically for the table and total sections Event listeners are added programmatically using JavaScript DOM API Data is saved on an Array and manipulated using Array methods Each bill is saved as an Object
